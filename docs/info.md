## How it works

Analog PLL targeted for 2.4GHz output, with a BGR circuit for the charge pump component.

## How to test

1. Connect OUT_FREQ to a multimeter, as the initial control voltage is 0V, it should be naturally outputting a 2.18GHz signal.
2. Connect REF_FREQ to a 20MHz signal. Either square wave of sinusoid are both are both ok as long as Vpp is 1.8V with respect to ground.
3. Inspect OUT_FREQ, within the settling time of 3us, the PLL output will converge to a 2.4GHZ signal.
## External hardware

1. Signal Generator (For the input)
2. Multimeter (To detect the output frequency)
